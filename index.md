# üëã Welcome !

I am **Perceval Beja-Battais**, currently a PhD student in applied mathematics at **[Centre Borelli](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/fr)**, supervised by [Nicolas Vayatis](https://nvayatis.perso.math.cnrs.fr/).  
I work on t the interface between **Machine Learning**, **optimization** and **dynamical systems** with an industrial applications to **Model Predictive Control** in nuclear engineering. My thesis is carried out within the framework of a CIFRE collaboration between academia and industry, in partnership with **[Framatome](framatome.com)**, and focuses on the development of new approaches for the simulation and control of complex physical systems.

My research interests include *physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), optimal control, uncertainty quantification*, and the *analysis of stability for nonlinear dynamical systems*. I am particularly interested in bridging classical methods from numerical analysis (e.g. collocation, adjoint-based optimization) with recent advances in Machine Learning to design hybrid algorithms that are both interpretable and scalable.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated from **[Mines Nancy](https://mines-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/)**, **ENS Paris-Saclay ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com)) & [Sorbonne Universit√©](https://www.ljll.fr/MathModel/)**, where I specialized in applied mathematics (See [CV]()). 

In the longer term, I am interested in exploring how advanced learning-based methods can be integrated into industrial decision-making processes, both in energy and beyond, and I am open to interdisciplinary collaborations at the interface between mathematics, physics and computer science.
